# report-generator
Repository to support generating reports through reading API endpoints. 
There are a lot of reports that organizations compile and different times. This project will help pull such reports through API endpoints, validate the reports 
and create files to simplify the process of manually compiling each report. For example, Partners in Health Malawi each quarter compiles over 150 HIV reports 
and each report needs to follow a specific naming convention and also sorting the reports. This project will solve this process faster and also ensure quality of data.
